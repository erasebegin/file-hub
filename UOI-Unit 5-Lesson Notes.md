### Imagining a world without simple machines

* Lesson 1
	* T gives a couple examples of the things in the classroom that are simple machines or that simple machines have been used to be make.
	* Use this to introduce Ss to the idea of a world without simple machines
	* Ss first discuss in groups what they are going to focus on. Each member of a group must choose 1 thing in the classroom to talk about. 
	* They must include:
		* Why this is a simple machine or why a simple machine is required to make this thing.
		* how this would change if there were no simple machines
		* Is there an alternative?
		* How would the things we do in the classroom change if we did not have this thing?
	* Ss are first allowed a few minutes to talk in groups to decide what each person is going to talk about. 
	* Ss report back and say what each member of their group will be discussing. Each person in a group must talk about something different.
	* Ss then, on their own, make notes in their book about their chosen object following the requirements above.  
	* Groups present to class. Each person only has to briefly and simply outline their thoughts.
