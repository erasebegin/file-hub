<ul>
<li>Lesson 1
<ul>
<li>T gives a couple examples of the things in the classroom that are simple machines or that simple machines have been used to be make.</li>
<li>Use this to introduce Ss to the idea of a world without simple machines</li>
<li>Ss first discuss in groups what they are going to focus on. Each member of a group must choose 1 thing in the classroom to talk about.</li>
<li>They must include:
<ul>
<li>Why this is a simple machine or why a simple machine is required to make this thing.</li>
<li>how this would change if there were no simple machines</li>
<li>Is there an alternative?</li>
<li>How would the things we do in the classroom change if we did not have this thing?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ss are first allowed a few minutes to talk in groups to decide what each person is going to talk about.</li>
<li>Ss report back and say what each member of their group will be discussing. Each person in a group must talk about something different.</li>
<li>Ss then, on their own, make notes in their book about their chosen object following the requirements above.</li>
<li>Groups present to class. Each person only has to briefly and simply outline their thoughts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
