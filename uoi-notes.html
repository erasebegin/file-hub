      Manga means ‘comic’ in Japanese. In Chinese 漫 means something that is
      done at will, that is improvised (随意), while 画 means to draw. So manga
      has always been quite spontaneous in nature. Drawings are usually quite
      simple, but very expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manga is said to have originated in Japan from scrolls dating back to the
      12th century, and it is believed they represent the basis for the
      right-to-left reading style.

      Among the first and to date most successful manga artists, there wereOsamu
      Tezuka[3], who created the famousAstro Boy, as well asMachiko Hasegawa,
      with hisSazae-san. Tezuka, known as the God of Manga and Godfather of
      Anime, invented the distinctive large eyes prominent in both fields.<br />

    <p>
      manga was strongly shaped by US cultural influences. It is said that the
      large, expressive eyes characteristic of modern manga came from American
      classics such as Betty Boop and Disney cartoons.

        Lesson 1
        <ul>
          <li>
            T gives a couple examples of the things in the classroom that are
            simple machines or that simple machines have been used to be make.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use this to introduce Ss to the idea of a world without simple
            machines
          </li>
          <li>
            Ss first discuss in groups what they are going to focus on. Each
            member of a group must choose 1 thing in the classroom to talk
            about.
          </li>
          <li>
            They must include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Why this is a simple machine or why a simple machine is required
                to make this thing.
              </li>
              <li>how this would change if there were no simple machines</li>
              <li>Is there an alternative?</li>
              <li>
                How would the things we do in the classroom change if we did not
                have this thing?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ss are first allowed a few minutes to talk in groups to decide what
            each person is going to talk about.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ss report back and say what each member of their group will be
            discussing. Each person in a group must talk about something
            different.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ss then, on their own, make notes in their book about their chosen
            object following the requirements above.
          </li>
          <li>
            Groups present to class. Each person only has to briefly and simply
            outline their thoughts.
